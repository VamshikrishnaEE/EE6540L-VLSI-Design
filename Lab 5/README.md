# D Flip-Flop Using NAND Gates and Inverter

## Overview

This project focuses on designing a **positive edge-triggered D Flip-Flop** with asynchronous preset and clear functionalities. The Flip-Flop was implemented using **NAND gates** and **inverters**. The design process involved modifying transistor widths to optimize propagation delays, ensuring consistent timing behavior.

Key steps included:
- Adjusting PMOS and NMOS widths in NAND gate schematics.
- Creating a D Flip-Flop schematic from NAND gates and inverters.
- Simulating and verifying the design for correct operation.
