# Inverter and NAND3 Layout Design

This project focuses on the design and layout of basic CMOS digital circuits using Cadence Virtuoso. The primary objective is to create and verify the layouts of an **Inverter** and a **3-input NAND gate (NAND3)**. (I write NAND3 just to make it sound like 3 input Nand Gate in shorter version).- [EE6540Lab-2.pdf](EE6540Lab-2.pdf) – Full lab report (download and open locally).

The design process involves:
- Creating transistor-level schematics.
- Deriving Euler paths for optimized routing.
- Constructing stick diagrams to guide layout.
- Implementing layouts using standard λ-based design rules.
- Verifying designs with Design Rule Check (DRC) for correctness.

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of CMOS VLSI layout design and reinforces hands-on experience with layout tools and design rules.
