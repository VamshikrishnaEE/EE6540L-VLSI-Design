# Lab 1 - 4-bit Prime Number Detector

## Objective
Design a 4-bit prime number detector using **CMOS logic gates** and implement it in **Cadence Virtuoso**. The detector outputs `1` for prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

## Files
- `EE6540L_LAB_1.pdf` – Full lab report with truth table, K-map, schematic, simulation results.
- `Schematic.png` – Schematic diagram designed in Cadence Virtuoso.
- `Waveform.png` – Simulation waveform showing correct prime detection.

## Tools Used
- **Cadence Virtuoso** for schematic design, layout, and simulation.
- **CMOS logic gates** as the building blocks.

## Results
- The 4-bit prime detector successfully detects prime numbers in the range 0-15.
- Simulation waveforms match expected outputs for prime numbers.

## Learnings
- Introduction to Cadence Virtuoso for schematic design and simulation.
- Designing combinational logic circuits for specific functional requirements.
- Importance of layout constraints and design rules in VLSI.
